## Problem Statement      
**Post Covid19 pandemic, the financial industry, particularly financial insurance, has seen an increase in fraud cases. Among these, customer fraud accounts for nearly 44% of losses caused by external actors in the financial sector, with 26% coming from customers, 24% coming from hacker attacks, and 19% coming from third parties (vendors). All other fraud types have also been identified. It's critical for insurance businesses to minimize possible losses using strategy, fraud detection technologies, and KYC.

## Objective     
**Developed fraud detection model using classification algorithm. To be more precise, I will use the cross validation with metrics f1_score (average of false positives and negatives) to identify which of the four classification algorithmsâ€”decision tree, random forest, SVC, or logreg is the best.**

## Technical Conclusion    
**f1 score = 74 %**        
**Best model = Decision Tree**        
**Pipeline = Added**
